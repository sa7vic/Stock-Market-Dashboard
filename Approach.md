While building the Stock Market Dashboard, my approach was to first design a clear architecture separating the frontend, backend, and database. I began with setting up the PostgreSQL database to store company data such as name, symbol, sector, and exchange. After creating the schema and seeding sample data, I moved on to building a REST API using Node.js and Express. The API endpoints were designed to handle fetching all companies, retrieving a specific company by ID, and extending in the future for stock price tracking. For the frontend, I used React.js to create a responsive and interactive dashboard where users can view and explore company data. The application follows a modular structure with reusable components, state management using hooks, and API integration to fetch live data from the backend.

The main technologies used were React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and PostgreSQL (hosted on Neon) as the database. Deployment was done using Render for the backend and a static hosting service for the React frontend. Environment variables were managed using .env files for security.

One of the key challenges I encountered was database connectivity during deployment. Initially, the backend was attempting to connect to a local PostgreSQL instance, which caused errors on Render. Configuring the Neon cloud database with SSL settings solved this issue. Another challenge was handling CORS errors when the frontend and backend were deployed on different domains. This was fixed by enabling proper CORS middleware in Express. These challenges provided valuable learning about deploying full-stack applications and managing cloud-hosted databases effectively.
